# Docs-as-System Project

This project was created using the Docs-as-System StarterKit (Hebrew edition).

## Next steps

1. Open `docs/agent/AGENT_CONFIG.yaml`  
   and configure the agent behavior for your project  
   (branches, logging, commit rules, allowed paths).

2. Review the documentation templates under `docs/`  
   These include planning, architecture, automation, logs, and project-level documents.

3. Start writing code inside the `src/` folder.  
   Keep the structure clean and aligned with the documentation.

4. Use your AI agent inside the IDE.  
   The project is now aligned with the Docs-as-System methodology and ready for development.

5. Update the documentation as the system evolves.  
   This keeps the project self-explanatory and consistent with the methodology.
